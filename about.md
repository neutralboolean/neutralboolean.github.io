This is my portfolio: the collected, digital works of Samuel David Osamuyime Ugowe.

I am due to graduate from Rutgers University - Camden in December of 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

I am familiar with C++, C, Java, and Python; and this website holds the best examples of my non-student work. Primarily hobby projects.
